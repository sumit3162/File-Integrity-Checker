## ⚠️ Notes

* This version stores hashes **in memory** (non-persistent). Restarting the server resets the scanned data.
* To make it production-ready, integrate a **database** like SQLite or MongoDB to persist hashes.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Add email notifications on modification
* Persistent database support
* User authentication
* Command-line interface (CLI)
